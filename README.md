AgriVision - Automated Farming Robot

Project Overview:
AgriVision is an advanced automated farming robot designed to optimize agricultural practices through automation and precision farming techniques. This project leverages data science and machine learning to enhance the efficiency of farming operations, contributing to sustainable agriculture and food security.

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to predict plant diseases using machine learning models. By analyzing data collected from the farm, the robot helps identify diseases early, allowing farmers to take preventive measures and reduce crop loss.

Features:
Real-time Data Monitoring: The robot collects real-time data from the farm, including soil moisture, temperature, and crop health indicators.

Disease Prediction: Machine learning models, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), are applied to predict plant diseases based on environmental and crop image data. Early detection allows for timely interventions.

Kaggle Integration: The project includes a setup for accessing and analyzing agricultural datasets from Kaggle to train the models for disease prediction.

Automation System: The robot autonomously handles essential tasks, reducing the need for manual labor while improving farm productivity.

Technologies Used:
-Python: Main programming language used for automation and data analysis.
-TensorFlow/Keras: Used to build and train the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
-Kaggle API: Used to download datasets for training and validation of machine learning models.
-Google Colab: Used for developing and testing the models.
-Machine Learning Libraries:
    *Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
    *Matplotlib for visualizations.
    *Scikit-learn for model evaluation.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
We used a CNN model to predict plant diseases by analyzing images of crops. The architecture includes multiple convolutional and pooling layers to extract features from the input images, followed by dense layers for classification. Key layers include:
-Convolutional layers to learn spatial hierarchies.
-Max Pooling layers to reduce dimensionality.
-Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

The model is built and trained on crop image data to classify whether a plant has a disease or not.
